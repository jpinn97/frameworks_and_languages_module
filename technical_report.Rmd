`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) "# Technical Report"`

The purpose of this report is to evaluate and critique the current
framework-less example server and client prototype, and justify and
describe an implementation that includes frameworks and specific
language features. For a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Single Page Application (SPA), the usage of frameworks and specific
languages are a necessity for the development of a commercial
application.

Building from scratch may offer complete control over every aspect of
the application if our application was highly unique, but we needn't
reinvent the wheel. Well-established frameworks generally have large
communities, and thus have a wealth of resources, documentation, and
support in addition to thoroughly tested and community driven features.
Which will enable us to develop faster, and maintain our application
more easily over the long term.

## Critique of Server/Client prototype

### Overview

Commercial applications typically require a server to be scalable,
maintainable, and optimized for performance. Hand-rolling solutions
commonly found in frameworks can lead to challenges in development as
application complexity grows, which occurs as new features are added and
extended to improve customer experience.

This stacks up technical debt, it's easier to hire developers who are
familiar with frameworks than it's to hire and train developers with a
custom in-house solution.

### Issue 1

The server is not scalable or capable of asynchronous or concurrent
operations.

Function Reference:

-   **Function Name**: `serve_app` \
-   **Located in**: `example_server/app/http_server.py` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Function](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/f396251252434a5a37f29d1ec684ac31d4644bbb/example_server/app/http_server.py#L99-L134)

``` python
def serve_app(func_app, port, host=''):
   with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
       s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
       s.bind((host, port))
       while True:
            s.listen()
           try:
               conn, addr = s.accept()
           except KeyboardInterrupt as ex:
               break
           with conn:
```

The function `serve_app` is used to listen for incoming connections, and
handle them. On line 104, the function `s.listen()` is called, which
will block the thread until a connection is made. This means that the server will not be able to handle any other requests until the current request is completed. 
Furthermore, according to [@am_i_helpfulAnswerWhatBacklog2016] and [@SocketLowlevelNetworking2023], the backlog size is influenced by the operating system (OS)'s SOMAXCONN, Linux is currently set to 4096 [@NetIncreaseSOMAXCONN2019], the large buffer of unaccepted connections will cause clients to experience latency if the server is under heavy load due to the sequential handling of requests.

``` python
#log.debug(f'Connected by ')
#while True:
data = conn.recv(65535)  # If the request does not come though in a single recv/packet then this server will fail and will not composit multiple TCP packets. Sometimes the head and the body are sent in sequential packets. This happens when the system switches task under load.
#if not data: break
try:
    request = parse_request(data)
except InvalidHTTPRequest as ex:
    log.exception("InvalidHTTPRequest")
    continue

# HACK: If we don't have a complete message - try to botch another recv - I feel dirty doing this 
# This probably wont work because utf8 decoded data will have a different content length 
# This needs more testing
while int(request.get('content-length', 0)) > len(request['body']):
    request['body'] += conn.recv(65535).decode('utf8')
```

The function struggles with handling TCP data that arrives in fragments, attempting to make additional recv calls to gather more data. It relies on the content-length header to decide if further recv calls are necessary. However, this approach fails to properly decode non-UTF-8 data, such as binary image data. 
Additionally, UTF-8's variable-width encoding has multibyte characters such as "C3 A9" occupying two bytes and is "Ã©" [@UTF82023] that might be split across different packets which when decoded could form an illegal sequence, leading to a UnicodeDecodeError [@UnicodeDecodeErrorPythonWiki2008]. As indicated in the comments on line 121, the actual body size can become larger than what the content-length suggests as data size increases once decoded. The server will drop the connection if the content-length is exceeded, which will result in a broken image or data corruption.

Finally, the function has no error handling in the case of timeouts or resource exhaustion.

### Issue 2

File Reference:

-   **File Name**: `index.html` \
-   **Location**: `example_client/index.html` \
-   **Description**: The example client. \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to File](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/0f55f66639768032a3f0c0d795e6517ca52f0a11/example_client/index.html)

A number of functions such as `renderItems`, `renderDataToTemplate`, `attachDeleteAction`, and `clear_node` directly manipulate the DOM. This is generally not recommended to do in such vast amounts. Especially when the functions are tightly coupled.

Take for example the functions [`renderItems`](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/0f55f66639768032a3f0c0d795e6517ca52f0a11/example_client/index.html#L402-L418) and `render_items`:

``` Javascript
function renderItems(data) {
    const $item_list = document.querySelector(`[data-page="items"] ul`);
    const new_item_element = () => document.querySelector(`[data-page="items"] li`).cloneNode(true);

    for (let item_data of data) {
        const $new_item_element = new_item_element();
        $item_list.appendChild($new_item_element);
        renderDataToTemplate(item_data, $new_item_element, renderItemListFieldLookup);
        attachDeleteAction($new_item_element);
        }
}
function render_items(params) {
    fetch(`${urlAPI}/items?${new URLSearchParams(params).toString()}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(renderItems)
        .catch(err => console.error(err));
        }
```

The DOM is directly manipulated to manage state, for instance the `document.querySelector` may not be performative on large trees. The DOM is a hierarchical tree structure, the `document.querySelector` function will traverse the entire tree to find the element. 
In a commercial setting, this way of rendering the fetched data and DOM is not scalable or performant, moreover, as the application grows teams will struggle to test and refactor due to the increasing complexity. The list is returned in full, some clients devices may suffer slower render times as the large list is rendered in full, due to the iterative and linear nature of the loop.

### Issue 3

Class Reference:
-  **Class Names**: `LatLon`, `LatLonRange` \
-  **Located in**: `example_client/index.html` \
-  **Source Code**: [Link to
    Classes](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/0f55f66639768032a3f0c0d795e6517ca52f0a11/example_server/app/datamodel.py#L4-L33)

The `LatLon` and `LatLonRange` classes are used to create tuples of coordinates, and later to test if an item is within the range of another item. These classes are very basic,
and have no validation, are very basic and have very little regard to efficiency.

``` python
class LatLon(NamedTuple):
    lat: float
    lon: float
    @staticmethod
    def from_dict(data):
        try:
            return LatLon(*tuple(float(data[i]) for i in ('lat', 'lon')))
        except (KeyError, TypeError):
            return None
class LatLonRange(NamedTuple):
    lat: float
    lon: float
    radius: float
    @staticmethod
    def from_dict(data):
        try:
            return LatLonRange(*tuple(float(data[i]) for i in ('lat', 'lon', 'radius')))
        except (KeyError, TypeError):
            return None
    def in_range(self, latlon:LatLon) -> bool:
        if isinstance(latlon, dict):
            latlon = LatLon.from_dict(latlon)
        if not latlon:
            return False
        return \
            (latlon.lat > self.lat - self.radius) and \
            (latlon.lat < self.lat + self.radius) and \
            (latlon.lon > self.lon - self.radius) and \
            (latlon.lon < self.lon + self.radius) and \
        True # <---------- SERVES NO PURPOSE
```
Firstly, the `LatLon` class has no validation, allowing invalid coordinates to be created.
The `in_range` function has linear performance scaling, as it will perform 4 comparisons for every item in the database. In a commercial setting, for this type of application, planning for hundreds of thousands if not millions of items is ideal. At this level, the performance of the `in_range` function will be unacceptable, and will need to be refactored to use a more efficient algorithm as wasted resources will be costly, and also lead to a poor customer experience.
A better approach would be to use an interim solution like GeoPandas [@DocumentationGeoPandasUntagged2024] before moving to a more scalable solution like PostGIS [@PostGIS2023]. GeoPandas is a Python library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and operations for manipulating geospatial data. Such as R-tree, Quadtree, and KD-tree spatial indexes, that work by reducing the overall search space and time. These indexes make it easier for the algorithm to find nearer items.

In the future once the commercial application has grown to need a fully fledged database, PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL. PostGIS provides spatial indexing features just like GeoPandas but on a larger scale. It also provides functions like converting address to lat/long, which would be useful for the application.


### Recommendation

The existing implementation hand-rolls various features such as decoding and parsing HTTP requests, that are already implemented in frameworks. Jamming code together so that it works is not a scalable solution, it's not time efficient to develop custom functionality that is already available in frameworks. 
Frameworks are designed to provide a higher level of abstraction, React state management [@StateSnapshotReact2024] for example would be better than the direct DOM manipulating being used, React's declarative approach is used to describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the DOM manipulation for us.

Considering the complex nature of the application, and commercial scalabality concerns, a database will no doubt be required, which will neccessitate the usage of something akin to PostGIS.

## Server Framework Features

Server Framework: Gin [@Documentation2022]

### Middleware

Middleware is an intermediary layer that is used to provide modular pre- or post-processing of data that is incoming/outgoing from an application route, whilst maintaining the core functionality of the routing function.

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `JSONMiddleware` \
-   **Located in**: `server/main.go` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Function](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/b4f100c7aaab889d54233723247817b870699c80/server/main.go#L44-L149) \
-   **Feature Documentation**: [Link to Feature](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/custom-middleware/)

``` Go
r.POST("/item", JSONMiddleware(), PostItemHandler)
```


When a client POSTs to the `/item` route, the `JSONMiddleware` function is called before the `PostItemHandler` function. 
  
``` Go
func JSONMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        // Read the request body and store it in a byte slice.
        body, err := c.GetRawData()
        if err != nil {
            c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
            c.Abort()
            return
        }

        // Unmarshal the JSON into itemMiddleware
        var customItem interface{}
        if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &customItem); err != nil {
            c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
            c.Abort()
            return
        }

        if m, ok := customItem.(map[string]interface{}); ok {
            keywordsValue, exists := m["keywords"]
            if !exists {
                // 'Keywords' field is not present, handle accordingly or skip it
            } else {
                switch keywords := keywordsValue.(type) {
                case string:
                    // Handle the case where 'Keywords' is a string
                    // Split the string by comma and store in a map
                    keywordsList := strings.Split(keywords, ",")
                    keywordMap := make(map[string]struct{})
                    for _, keyword := range keywordsList {
                        keywordMap[keyword] = struct{}{}
                    }
                    m["keywords"] = keywordMap
                case []interface{}:
                    // Handle the case where 'Keywords' is a slice of interfaces
                    // Iterate through the elements and process them as needed.
                    keywordMap := make(map[string]struct{})
                    for _, val := range keywords {
                        if keyword, ok := val.(string); ok {
                            // Add the string value to the map
                            keywordMap[keyword] = struct{}{}
                        }
                    }
                    m["keywords"] = keywordMap
                default:
                    c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": "Invalid 'Keywords' field type"})
                    c.Abort()
                    return
..
...
   
          // Set the request body to the updated JSON data.
          c.Request.Body = io.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(updatedBody))
   
          // Call the next handler.
          c.Next()
      }
   }
```

The `JSONMiddleware` function, implemented from the Gin framework [@CustomMiddleware2022], is used to pre-process the incoming request body, perform validation and transformation of keywords and other field values. The data is modified to the correct format that the `PostItemHandler` function and server expects, it then updates the body with the new bytes. The `PostItemHandler` function is then called, and the request body is parsed, none the wiser of the middleware modifications.

This encapsulates the core functionality of the `PostItemHandler` function, which is to create and store a new item. Furthermore, error handling is done by the middleware, which prevents propagation of malformed data entering deeper into the application. Finally, componentization increases the maintainability and testability of the application as changes are isolated to the middleware function.

Gin middleware is preferred over the standard Go `net/http` package:
- Less boilerplate.
- pre-built logging, recovery, and static file serving middleware.
- Less cognitive load, the `net/http` package requires the developer to understand the `http.Handler` interface more deeply.

### Automatic Binding of JSON to custom struct


The `gin.Context` struct is a simplified, and more developer friendly interface to the `net/http` package. It provides a number of methods for HTTP requests and response handling, data binding, rendering and middleware support.

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `gin.Context` Automatic Model/Binding of JSON to custom struct \
-   **Located in**: `server/main.go` 

``` Go
// Call ShouldBindJSON to attempt to bind the received JSON to Item struct.
if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&ReceivedData); err != nil {
     c.JSON(http.StatusMethodNotAllowed, gin.H{
         "error":       "Invalid input",
         "description": "Some input fields may be missing",
     })
     return
}
```

``` Go
 type itemMiddleware struct {
    User_ID     string              `json:"user_id" binding:"required"`
    Keywords    map[string]struct{} `json:"keywords" binding:"required"`
    Description string              `json:"description" binding:"required"`
    Image       *string             `json:"image,omitempty"`
    Lat         float64             `json:"lat" binding:"required"`
    Lon         float64             `json:"lon" binding:"required"`
}
```

The `gin.Context` allows automatic binding and validation of JSON data to a custom struct, Gin provides the additional `binding` tag option to the struct fields [@BindFormdataRequest2022]. This allows the developer to specify the required fields, and the `ShouldBindJSON` [@ModelBindingValidation2022] function will return an error if the required fields are missing. This saves development time, as Go requires significantly more boilerplate to achieve the same functionality through unmarshaling and manual validation.

### Built-in Rendering

-   **Feature Name**: `c.Data` \
-   **Located in**: `server/main.go` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Function](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/b4f100c7aaab889d54233723247817b870699c80/server/main.go#L221) \
-   **Feature Documentation**: [Link to Feature](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/html-rendering/)

Gin's c.Data method is a built-in rendering feature for sending raw data as an HTTP response. It allows setting custom Content-Type headers and directly writing byte data to the response body, useful for various content types including HTML.

``` Gin
220.	// Write README.md to response.
221.	c.Data(http.StatusOK, "text/html; charset=utf-8", readmeBytes)
```

This feature streamlines sending custom content types, like HTML, without manual data writing and header management. It simplifies response generation via an API, enhances flexibility, and is beneficial when serving non-JSON content, such as images or HTML. This allows us to serve the README.md on Github, and statically at the root of the server as HTML. Moreover, this feature works for other data types such as JSON, XML, YAML, and Protobuf which provides additionally extensibility and flexibility.

## Server Language Features

Server Language: Golang (Go) [@DocumentationGoProgramming2023]

### Goroutines and Concurrency

Gin is based off the Go standard library's `net/http` package, and spawns one goroutine per connection [@GoSrcNet2023].

``` Go
func (srv *Server) Serve(l net.Listener) error {
..
go c.serve(connCtx)
}
```
Goroutines are lightweight threads, which have a small, often a few kilobytes of initial stack space that grows and drinks. Concurrency is achieved by the Go runtime that manages resources and CPU time of goroutines, and their state; when a goroutine performs a blocking I/O operation, it is suspended, and the scheduler can run other goroutines until the I/O operation completes.

Channels provide a way to synchronize and pass data between goroutines, ensuring safe and efficient sharing of information [@EffectiveGoGo2009].

In a multi-core system, the Go runtime will multiplex/interleave goroutines across multiple OS threads, which enables parallelism, combined with work stealing; idle threads taking over other busy thread goroutines to balance load.

Goroutines ensure optimal usage of CPU time and efficiency of resources, as HTTP requests from connections are handled concurrently, and in parallel, without blocking the main thread. The scalabality of the server is proportional to the CPU cores/threads, and memory available.

### Synchronization

Enabling concurrency requires synchronization of certain resources as the stores items, and keys. The Go standard library provides two primitives, mutex [@SyncPackageSync2023] and atomic [@AtomicPackageSync2023]:

-   **Feature Name**: `Mutual Exclusion Lock, Atomic Primitives` \
-   **Located in**: `server/main.go` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Function](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/server/main.go#L230-L275) \
-   **Feature Documentation**: Mutex: [@SyncPackageSync2023] Atomic:[@AtomicPackageSync2023]

```Go
func PostItemHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	// Will attempt to bind to ItemPOST struct.
	var ReceivedData itemMiddleware

	// Call ShouldBindJSON to attempt to bind the received JSON to Item struct.
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&ReceivedData); err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusMethodNotAllowed, gin.H{
			"error":       "Invalid input",
			"description": "Some input fields may be missing",
		})
		return
	}

	currentTime := time.Now().Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999-0000")
	parsedTime, err := time.Parse("2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999-0000", currentTime)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{
			"error":       "Internal Server Error",
			"description": "Something went wrong :(",
		})
		return
	}

	newId := atomic.LoadInt64(&idCounter) // Safely read counter.
	atomic.AddInt64(&idCounter, 1)        // Safetly increment counter.

	StoredData := Item{
		ID:          newId,
		User_ID:     ReceivedData.User_ID,
		Keywords:    ReceivedData.Keywords,
		Description: ReceivedData.Description,
		Image:       ReceivedData.Image,
		Lat:         ReceivedData.Lat,
		Lon:         ReceivedData.Lon,
		Date_from:   parsedTime,
		Date_to:     nil,
	}

	itemsMu.Lock() // Lock item mutex for write, thus locking the Items map.
	defer itemsMu.Unlock()
	items[newId] = StoredData
	keys = append(keys, newId)

	c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, StoredData)
}
```
In Go, maps are not concurrently safe. This is because race conditions or data corruption can occur when goroutines access/modify the map. The `itemsMu` mutex is used to ensure safe reading and writing of the `items` map. A goroutine aqcuires the `itemsMu.Lock()` for writing, performs the modification, and releases lock. In this mean time, other goroutines are scheduled and blocked from writing. Whilst this is happening, other functions such as `GetItemHandler` can safely read the map, as the mutex is not locked for reading. 

The atomic indivisible operations `atomic.LoadInt64` and `atomic.AddInt64` ensure the `idCounter` is safely incremented, and read, which is used to maintain order of insertion of the `items` map through the `keys` slice and generate unique IDs for each item.

Take Goroutines 1 and 2, they both attempt a read-write-cycle on `idCounter` using a low-level CPU instruction compare-and-swap (CAS) mechanism [@Compareandswap2023]. Usually the Go runtime will schedule Goroutine A, to perform its operation in entirety without interruption from B. 

However, both can occur at roughly the same time:

#### Goroutine 1:
Loads counter value (e.g., 10).
Prepares to increment (expected value: 10, new value: 11).

#### Goroutine 2: (roughly at the same time)
Loads counter value (10).
Prepares to increment (expected value: 10, new value: 11).

#### CAS Execution:
Goroutine 1: CAS succeeds, updating counter to 11.
Goroutine 2: CAS fails (expected 10, but it's now 11), indicating a concurrent modification.

#### Retry:
Goroutine 2: Reloads counter value (11).
Prepares incremented value (expected: 11, new: 12).
CAS succeeds, updating counter to 12.

These primitives are required for handling safe concurrent acccess to shared-resources in a scalable, high-traffic server.

## Client Framework Features

### Component Based Architecture

In React, a functional component is a Javascript function that is designed to be modular and reusable. Each component is a function that returns a React element, their state, logic and rendering is encapsulated within the function, enhancing maintainability and organization of the codebase.

Component Reference:

-   **Component Name**: `App` \
-   **Located in**: `client/src/App.tsx` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Reference](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/client/src/App.tsx#L45-L72)

``` Javascript
return (
    <div>
      <NavigationBar />

      {/* Main content container */}
      <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
            <PostItemForm onSubmit={getItems} />
          </div>
          <div className="bg-gray-300 p-4">
            {items && (
              <ul className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2">
                {items.map((item) => (
                  <li
                    key={item.id}
                    className="px-2 w-full sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 xl:w-1/3"
                  >
                    <ListItem onDeleteItem={onDeleteItem} item={item} />
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

The `App` component splits the UI into dividable components, `ListItem`, `NavigationBar`, and `PostItemsForm`. This declarative way of describing the UI, is much more intuitive and readable than any verbose DOM management. Furthermore, components allow us to reduce DOM manipulation and improve state management. If we recieve a list of items from the server, we can simply update the state of the App component, and the `ListItem` component will automatically re-render with the new data.


### State

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `State` \
-   **Located in**: `client/src/App.tsx` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Reference](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/client/src/App.tsx#L13-L40)

State is a feature that components use to store and manage data dynamically. State is managed primarily by hooks, when a item is posted the client will check the server for any updated items, and update the state of the `App` component. This will automatically re-render the `ListItem` child components with the new data.

``` Javascript
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const getItems = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const itemData: Item[] = await apiService.getItems();
      console.log("Items from server:", itemData); // Log the response from the server
      setItems(itemData);
      setLoading(false);
      return itemData;
    } catch (err: unknown) {
      console.error(err);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const onDeleteItem = async (id: number) => {
    await apiService.deleteItem(id);
    // Check if the delete request was successful
    console.log("I just deleted an item!");
    await getItems(); // Fetch the updated list of items
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Items:", items);
  }, [items]);
```

The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable, and a function to update the state variable. In the function `getItems`, updates the `items` list with the retrieved server data. This simple function results in the `ListItem` component being rendered with new data. React under the hood performed the neccessary DOM manipulation to update the `ListItem` component automatically.

### Props

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `Props` \
-   **Located in**: `client/src/components/ListItem.tsx` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Reference](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/client/src/components/ListItem.tsx#L8-L40)

Props are used to pass arguements (data, functions) unidirectionally from a parent component to a child component. The `ListItem` component recieves the `onDeleteItem` function and `item` data from the `App` component. The `onDeleteItem` function is used to delete an item from the server, and the `item` data is used to render the item data. 

``` Javascript
function ListItem({ onDeleteItem, item }: ListItemProps) {
  return (
    <div className="border-soiid border-2 border-black max-w-max">
      <div data-field="id" key={item.id}>
        User ID: {item.user_id}
        <br />
        <div data-field="description">Description: {item.description}</div>
        <br />
        <ul>
          Keywords:{" "}
          {Object.keys(item.keywords).map((keyword) => (
            <li key={keyword}>- {keyword}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <img className="object-scale-down h-48 w-96" src={item.image}></img>
        <br />
        Latitude: {item.lat}
        <br />
        Longitude: {item.lon}
        <br />
        Date From: {item.date_from}
        <br />
      </div>
      <button
        data-action="delete"
        className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
        onClick={() => onDeleteItem(item.id)}
      >
        Delete
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This reusable component, can render any number of items, parsing the `App` item data allows us to eliminate the need for internal state to the component. Props enables separations of concerns, as the ListItem is focused on rendering the item data, and the App component is focused on managing the state of the application.
## Client Language Features

### Static Typing

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that when compiled produces Javascript. TypeScript's biggest offering is static typing, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that variables can be assigned any type of value and are inferred at runtime. TypeScript allows us to specify the type of a variable, and the compiler will check if the variable is assigned the correct type. This is useful for catching bugs, and improving code quality before running the application.

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `Static Typing` \
-   **Located in**: `client/src/api_service.ts` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Reference](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/client/src/api_service.ts#L59-L74)

``` TypeScript
async function postItem<T>(formData: Item): Promise<T> {
  const fullUrl = `${url}/item`;
  const response = await fetch(fullUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(response.statusText);
  }

  return (await response.json()) as T;
}
```

The intended data type is specified when declaring a variable. In the example above, the `postItem` function is declared to return a generic type `T`, which is asserted by the `return (await response.json()) as T;` statement, the function also expects a `formData` variable of type `Item`.  The compiler then analyzes and checks the code for type safety, and will throw an error if the variable is assigned the wrong type. This treatment is akin to guardrails for developers, and enhances overall code structure and should reduce the likelihood of early runtime errors.

This increases the readability and clarity of the code, as the developer can more easily understand the types of data that is being passed around the application, which in a commercial application should reduce the cognitive load.

### Interfaces

In a commercial application where the codebase is large and complex, interfaces allow a clear and communicative of defining the structure of an object, and the types of its properties. Any change to the interface will cascade to all objects that implement the interface, which is useful for maintaining consistency across the application.

Feature Reference:

-   **Feature Name**: `Interface` \
-   **Located in**: `client/src/api_service.ts` \
-   **Source Code**: [Link to
    Reference](https://github.com/jpinn97/frameworks_and_languages_module/blob/7c30c485d2d33c0666fd4f8360ebcb1c40d07a7e/client/src/api_service.ts#L4-L14)

``` TypeScript
export interface Item {
  id?: number;
  user_id: string;
  keywords: { [key: string]: string };
  description: string;
  image?: string;
  lat: number;
  lon: number;
  date_from?: string;
  date_to?: string;
}
```

Think of the interface as a blueprint, any object that implements the interface must adhere to the blueprint. If an function is expecting an object of type `Item`, a developer may expect the `lat` or `lon` as a string. Without an interface, Javascript will be required to infer and check the type at runtime, furthermore, runtime errors may occur and cost the developer time to debug.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the assessment of the prototype server/client application demonstrates the substantial benefits of employing frameworks in the development of commercial software, particularly for a CRUD-based Single Page Application (SPA). Frameworks offer a structured approach, encapsulating best practices, reducing development time, and enhancing maintainability. They provide robust solutions to common problems, allowing developers to focus on unique application features rather than re-implementing foundational elements.

For the server, the Gin framework in Go is recommended due to its efficient handling of concurrency with goroutines, robust middleware support, and intuitive API for handling HTTP requests and JSON data binding. These features facilitate the creation of scalable, high-performance web services. The middleware feature, for instance, streamlines request processing and validation, ensuring data integrity and application security.

On the client side, React's component-based architecture is ideal for managing the SPA's state and user interface. Its declarative nature simplifies the rendering process, enhancing the application's maintainability and scalability. The usage of TypeScript adds the benefit of static typing, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors, which is critical in a commercial environment.

Overall, the combination of Gin and React, complemented by TypeScript, provides a comprehensive solution for developing scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications. Their community support, extensive documentation, and alignment with modern web development practices make them a sound choice for this project.
